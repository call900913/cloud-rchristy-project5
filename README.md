# README

This project is a Would You Rather game with a Serverless backend hosted on AWS. React controls its UI and Redux manages its state.

It is a continuation of another one of call900913's React project: [https://github.com/call900913/react-rchristy-project2](https://github.com/call900913/react-rchristy-project2).

And this app also has some cool features on the backend, such as X-Ray Tracing (courtesy of AWS).
